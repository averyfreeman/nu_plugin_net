# Design QA

Date: 2026-09-08
Final result: passed

## Reference evidence

The supplied wide-viewport references were reviewed at:

- `/tmp/codex-clipboard-6c810d6c-80a9-4386-84bf-6ab8029860e6.png`
- `/tmp/codex-clipboard-bde55768-1abc-4e60-b6cc-36b0e7d64e0b.png`
- `/tmp/codex-clipboard-12e52e4f-c412-4691-89e0-e196c3466de0.png`
- `/tmp/codex-clipboard-3906dab0-b54b-4440-a82d-adf384c85927.png`

The first two references show the original wide-viewport skew and narrow hero. The last two establish the preferred corner-toggle visual language.

## Implementation evidence

The implementation was inspected in the Codex In-app Browser at a 1265 x 713 CSS viewport using the local preview:

- Overview: `http://localhost:4321/nu_plugin_net/`
- Install with rails collapsed: `http://localhost:4321/nu_plugin_net/guides/install/?fresh=4`
- Install with both rails open: same URL after activating both corner controls

The browser capture was reviewed inline because the CUA screenshot API exposes the image to the QA session but does not persist a filesystem path.

## Comparison findings

- Layout: Overview now uses a dedicated Astro route with no left sidebar or right TOC at any width. Its content wrapper is full-width and centered, and the hero copy uses the same broad content system as the sections below it.
- Layout: Documentation routes start with both rails hidden. On desktop, opening either rail keeps the article centered; opening both gives the navigation and TOC matching `--net-doc-rail-width` values.
- Responsiveness: The right toggle is hidden below 768px. The left toggle delegates to Starlight's mobile popover behavior, preserving the narrow-screen navigation pattern.
- Typography and color: The existing Starlight blue tokens remain the strong gradient endpoint, while seafoam replaces the prior magenta/purple accent. The serif italic emphasis remains in the heading system.
- Interaction: The Overview has one primary hero action, `Read the guide`, and the lower `Get started` action points to the same base-aware Installation route. The Overview sidebar entry resolves back to `/`. Corner controls expose expanded/collapsed ARIA state and keyboard-focus styling.
- Icons: The controls use Starlight's real `bars` icon, with the right control rotated to distinguish the TOC action. This is the hamburger alternative explicitly allowed in the request.
- Accessibility: Controls are semantic buttons with labels and titles. Reduced-motion rules remain active for reveal animations and the terminal demo.

## Findings requiring no further action

- The implementation viewport is not pixel-identical to the source screenshots because the source captured a different browser frame and the requested behavior intentionally removes rails from Overview. The layout intent, centered article geometry, and documentation shell behavior were compared at the local preview viewport instead.
- No P0, P1, or P2 visual, interaction, or accessibility issues were found in the requested flow.

## Verification history

- `npm run validate:examples` passed with Nushell.
- `npm run build` passed, including generated Rustdoc and Pagefind.
- Generated landing links were checked to include `/nu_plugin_net/`, and the primary CTA was followed in the browser to the Install page without a 404.
- Added the project favicon and project-owned 404 route; the Astro/Starlight warnings reported during development no longer appear in the build output.
- Browser checks covered Overview, Install with collapsed rails, Install with the left rail open, and Install with both rails open.
